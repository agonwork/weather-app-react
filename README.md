# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

To run this project type "npm install" in the CLI to install dependencies required by Vite. This step ensures that your existing project has all the packages needed to work seamlessly with Vite.
Start the server in your existing project directory using the following command "npm run dev" which gives you a port e.g localhost/5100
And youre good to go
